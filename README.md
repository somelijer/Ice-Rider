# ICE RIDER

This was a game i created in 2021 while i was experimenting with Unity and learning about game engines.
The goal of the game was to be challenging, but fun to play.
It has 9 levels in rising difficulty and has a leaderboard implemented.
There are two types of levels: flying and driving

Have fun!
